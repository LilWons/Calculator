**Simple Scientific Calculator**

**Features**

This is a simple scientific calculator app developed in Android Studio.
The calculator has memory functions that allow you to add and subtract from the memory buffer, as well as the ability to follow BEDMAS and compute large expressions. Plus, the calculator detects syntax errors.

**Memory Functions** 

To use the memory functions, press the shift key. Once the shift key is enabled the memory buttons are highlighted orange. 
M+ adds the current calculation result to memory. 
M- subtracts the current calculation result to memory.
MR reads the current value in memory.  
MC clears the current value in memory.

**How Expressions are computed**

Expressions are first formatted than computed following BEDMAS.

3π4→3*π*4 = 37.6991

2÷3π4→2÷3*π*4 = 8.37758

60*150%→60*0.15 = 90
